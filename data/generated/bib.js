        "abstract": "Drying the samples was performed in the inlet temperatures of 45, 50, and 55 $\\,^{\\circ}$C, air velocity of 3.2, 6.8, and 9.1 m s\u22121, and bed depth of 1.5, 2.2, and 3 cm. The effects of these parameters were evaluated on energy utilization, energy efficiency and utilization ratio and exergy loss and efficiency. Furthermore, artificial neural network was employed in order to predict the energy and exergy parameters, and simulation of thermodynamic drying process was carried out, using the ANN created. A network was constructed from learning algorithms and transfer functions that could predict, with good accuracy, the exergy and energy parameters related to the drying process. The results revealed that energy utilization, efficiency, and utilization ratio increased by increasing the air velocity and depth of the bed; however, energy utilization and efficiency were augmented by increasing the temperature; additionally, energy utilization ratio decreased along with the rise in temperature. Also was found that exergy loss and efficiency improved by increasing the air velocity, temperature, and depth of the bed. Finally, the results of the statistical analyses indicated that neural networks can be utilized in intelligent drying process which has a large share of energy utilization in the food industry.",

        "abstract": "In the present study, moisture content evolution of cylindrical quince slices during convective drying was modelled by using artificial neural networks (ANN). Quince slices with an average initial moisture content of 81% in wet basis (w.b.) or 4.27\u202fkgwater/kgdry matter in dry basis (d.b.), were dried in a laboratory thermal convective dryer and experimental data of moisture content versus drying time was obtained for nine measurement groups of 40, 50 and 60\u202f$\\,^{\\circ}$C drying air temperature and 1, 2 and 3\u202fm/s airflow velocity respectively. Different topologies of multilayer perceptron (MLP) ANN models containing a single or two hidden layers with a different number of hidden neurons and different types of transfer functions, have been investigated for predicting the moisture content evolution during drying. A group k-fold cross validation iteration procedure was performed for each developed ANN structure, in order to assess each model's ability to estimate the moisture content of quinces on unseen data of air-drying temperature and airflow velocity combinations held out of the training process. For the cross validation of the developed ANN models, appropriate statistical evaluation indices were applied. The best performed ANN model based on the cross validation score metrics, contained two hidden layers with the sigmoid, softplus transfer functions and was composed by 90 artificial hidden neurons in each of the two hidden layers. A satisfying agreement of predictions with the experimental data was noticed, achieving coefficients of determination (R2) greater than 99% and root mean square error (RMSE) values less than 0.08\u202fkgwater/kgdry matter.",

        "abstract": "Freeze-drying is a method used for valuable and heat-sensitive products, ensuring that the product features are best protected. In this study, the pomelo fruit (Citrus maxima) peel samples were dried in two different thicknesses (5\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202fcm and 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.5\u202fcm) by freeze drying (FD) as well as forced convection (FCD) and microwave drying. According to the experimental results, it was observed that the thin sample dried in a shorter time in all drying methods. Besides, the shortest drying time was seen in microwave drying method. The experimental results were modeled with artificial neural networks which is one of the machine learning approaches. Two different models were developed to predict drying parameters. The first model predicts mass-dependent parameters (sample mass, moisture content, and moisture ratio). The second model was developed for drying time predictions. At the same time, it is intended that users can quickly and simply predict the specified parameters thanks to the smart interface developed.",

        "abstract": "Freeze drying is the best drying technology regarding quality of the end product but it is an expensive method and the high costs of process limit its application to industrial scale. At the same time, the freeze-drying process is based on different parameters, such as drying time, pressure, sample thicknesses, chamber temperature, sample temperatures and relative humidity. So, the determination of drying behaviors, such as moisture content (MC), moisture ratio (MR) and drying rate (DR), of the freeze-drying process are too complex. In this paper, to help the freeze dryer designer and simplify this complex process, the use of artificial neural networks has been proposed. An artificial neural networks (ANN) model has been developed for determination the prediction of drying behaviors, such as MC, MR and DR, of apples in the freeze-drying process. The back-propagation learning algorithm with variant which is Levenberg--Marquardt (LM) and Fermi transfer function have been used in the network. In addition, the statistical validity of the developed model has been determined by using the coefficient of determination (R2), the root means square error (RMSE) and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). R2, RMSE and MAPE have been determined for MC, MR and DR, as 0.999, 0.0078895, 0.2668459, and 0.999, 0.0001099, 0.2968427 and 0.999, 0.0000008, 0.2703797, respectively.",
